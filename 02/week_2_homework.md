# Programming Data Science

Homework for week 2

Topic of the week: Mapping questions to model classes, statements, and tests.

Learning objectives:

```text
> Students will learn 
- what computers can learn from data
- how to map tests/ models to data types 
```

## What do I have to prepare?

1. Think about the phrase: "Correlation is not causation." Think: what is causation? What is correlation? What is the _difference_?
2. Keep working on Python or R if you need to.

## What if I want to know more?

The following resources will provide background information, a broader perspective, or more details. Although you do not have to go through these materials, if you want to know more, they might be interesting.

1. Judea Pearl has an intersting book about cause and effects:

   * Judea Pearl and Dana MacKenzie (2018), [The Book of Why](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/)
   * A [review at the NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/business/dealbook/review-the-book-of-why-examines-the-science-of-cause-and-effect.html)
   * An interview with Pearl about [intelligence and deep learning](https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-build-truly-intelligent-machines-teach-them-cause-and-effect-20180515/)

2. There are far too many statistical test to list here. Luckily, some cheat cheets, summaries, and short essays are available that summarize when you should use what. I particularly like the following resources on that topic: 

    * When to use what? [A nice table.](https://towardsdatascience.com/demystifying-statistical-analysis-1-a-handy-cheat-sheet-b6229bf992cf)
    * The stats tutor's quick guide to commonly used tests: [PDF](http://www.statstutor.ac.uk/resources/uploaded/tutorsquickguidetostatistics.pdf)
    * Another [overview](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/whatstat/), with links to R

3. An more empirical perspective on mediation: [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI5y6pV87-Q) on causal mediation, the instructor is [Tyler VanderWeele](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/tyler-vanderweele/). This is advanced material, it might be interesting for doctoral students trying to explain causal effects from data using mediation.

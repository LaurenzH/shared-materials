_Dear data scientists,_ 

this is Anne, your contact at ebuy! Thanks for looking into our data. We have really not spent enough time in these things, you know, the daily business is really overwhelming sometimes. Steven (our developer) has extracted the data for you just like you wanted it. As far as I undestood, it contains information about our sales. Steven will be busy for the coming weeks and he is traveling. I don't think he will be available to answer questions, but we have copied a documentation for the data that you can look into.

As to what we are looking for, everything really. We have spent little to no time with data in the past and we would like to know what the data looks like. Many of us are in marketing, so we care a lot about our consumers and products and maybe that would be interesting to look at. Steven likes numbers, but most of us really prefer images, so can you please do both? The images should be easy to understand so that I can show them to my manager.

I will talk to my colleagues about what they want to see and will contact you soon.

Anyway, that's it for now. 
Good luck with your analysis!

Anne from Ebuy Inc.

Sales manager

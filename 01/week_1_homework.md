Topic of the week: _Organization of the course, basic project management._

Learning objectives:

```text
> No preparation if you can code, see below otherwise.
```

If you do not have programming skills in R or Python:

- search the web, there are enough free turorials available, or use [this list as a starting point](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md#python) (recommended).
- install languages and get going. You must be able to write a simple `Hello World` in R and Python. This course is not an introductory programming course. A working knowledge in Python or R is required.
- If you know Python, but not R, it might be a good idea to not start from scratch, but use the R introduction in [Hadley Wickham's book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).
- First real coding assignemnts are due in weeks 3 and 4. Until then, you should have enough time to work through R tutorials and/ or the Wickhams book.

# Programming Data Science

This repository contains all student materials (assignments, data, ...) for the _programming data science_ course in summer 2019.

If you participate in the course, please send an email to JÃ¶rn Grahl and ask for access. 

I grant students read-only access as a collaborator. Please fetch updates regularly.

Here is the tentative schedule for summer 2019:
